## How to run a file

1: Clone the project to your local 
2: Install the all the necessary dependancies (frontend and backend) using 

bash
npm run install-all


3: run front end using 

bash
npm run start-frontend


4: run backend using 

bash
npm run start-backend


Make sure you run both frontend and backend simultaneously for the UI and API calls to work
